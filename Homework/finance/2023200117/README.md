# Suggestions for Homework:Application_Letter
1. Use pathlib instead of string operations for path handling

2. Wrap the single file generation process in try/except blocks: when one record fails, log the error and continue with subsequent generations instead of interrupting the entire batch task

3. Avoid creating only one DocxTemplate instance outside the loop and repeatedly rendering it (some template libraries may modify internal state during rendering). A safer approach is to re-instantiate the template before each render:
```python
doc = DocxTemplate(template_path) # Inside each loop iteration
```
