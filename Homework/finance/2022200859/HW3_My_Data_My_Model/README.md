This is the folder for HW3.  
The folder "Step_by_Step_Code" contains my detailed codes which was divided into different cells. When I was coding, I divided the entire process into the following steps.  
The file "Final_Code.ipynb" is the result of merging all codes so TA can run it with one click.
