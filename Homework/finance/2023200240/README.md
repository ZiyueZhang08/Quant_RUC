1. Avoid nesting multiple try/except blocks; consider extracting the logic into separate functions for better readability and maintainability.

2. The approach for `convert_price`, ``convert_rent`, and `convert_area` is acceptable, but could be made more robust by using regular expressions for number extraction. Additionally, explicitly handle None and NaN values before returning results.

3. Ensure you complete the modeling part.
