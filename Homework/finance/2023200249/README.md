# Suggestions for Homework: Big Data

1. You can efficiently implement one-hot encoding using sklearn's OneHotEncoder to streamline the preprocessing of categorical variables.
2. Remember to address outliers before proceeding with model building to ensure more reliable results.
3. Avoid nesting multiple try/except blocks; consider extracting the logic into separate functions for better readability and maintainability.
