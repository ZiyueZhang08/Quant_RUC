# Homework feedback
## Homework 2

1. Your assignment score is 8.5/10.0，nice work.
2. Using absolute paths is not convenient for cross-platform use. 
3. Use tqdm to  display a progress bar; if there is an error, show the cause of the error  instead of outputting the result of each subtask (such as doc to pdf  conversion) in a loop. This approach can make the log smaller and clearer.
