# Homework Feedback
The overall score of your work is 9/10. Very Professional.

## Advice
1. You submitted a .py file renamed as .ipynb, which cannot be opened directly.
2. While your advanced features (CLI args, alias mapping, name-key protection) are impressive, they may exceed assignment requirements. For coursework, simpler solutions that meet requirements are often preferred.
