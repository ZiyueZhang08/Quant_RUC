1. Your assignment score is 8.0/10.0, nice work.
2. It is recommended to use AI tools to assist in completing programming tasks and learn basic programming logic from them.
3. Path management could be more standardized rather than relying entirely on absolute paths, which may inconvenience collaborators or supervisors when reproducing the code. 
4. Lack of progress bar management; consider using the tqdm package.
