The overall score of your work is 9.5/10. Excellent Work!

## Advice
1.Use relative paths instead of absolute paths (e.g., "D:/1 大四上/..."). This will make your code portable and runnable on other computers. Consider using os.path.join() with a base directory.

2.Sanitize filenames to handle special characters. University names may contain illegal characters for filenames (such as :, /, \, etc.).
