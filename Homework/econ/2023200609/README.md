#### HW1: sololearn certificates

- Done


#### HW2: University Applications Letters Generator
- Score: Please check in the Class `Econ` `.md` file.
- Comments:
    - .py is okay, but u can try using .ipynb next time.
    - You can improve your code with `random` universities (we want to randomly select universities from different rank groups.)


#### HW3: My_Data_My_Model

- Score: Please check in the Class `Econ` `.md` file.
- Comments:
    - `.py` is okay, but please use `.ipynb` next time. (IMPORTANT, because we need the `log` and `output` of your code.) (*We need to `minus 0.25` for the reason we couldn't get the `output` of your `.py` file.*)
    - One little suggestion: You could try to download (scrap) data without the parameter `max_pages` in `HW_3_step1.py` file.
    - We need your explanation of your results, not just the conclusion of <u> how to select models <u>.
