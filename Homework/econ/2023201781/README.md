#### HW1: sololearn certificates

- Done


#### HW2: University Applications Letters Generator

- Score: 9.0
- Suggestions: 
    - You can improve your code with `random` universities (we want to randomly select universities from different rank groups.)
    - In `Jupyter Notebook` or `Jupyter Lab` `pip install` need former `!` in `Windows` env and `%` in `Linux` env.

#### HW3: My_Data_My_Model

- Score: 8.5
- Comments:
  - you can shift `markdown/python` when creating a new clode block and use markdown for title and explanation(e.g.: you're using "# 数据处理与分析" in a python code block while in fact you can put it in a md block, after shift+enter it can be interpreted into markdown title)
  - Only `import` at the beginning of the code; no need to import in every cell.
