#### HW1: sololearn certificates


- Done

#### HW2: University Applications Letters Generator
- Score: Please check in the Class `Econ` `.md` file.
- Comments:
  -  You can improve your code with `random` universities (we want to randomly select universities from different rank groups.)


#### HW3: My_Data_My_Model

- Score: Please check in the Class `Econ` `.md` file.
- Comments:
  - Please save all the `log` and `output` information with you in the `.ipynb` file.
  - You are expected to use `statsmodels` library for your linear regression model for data statistics (ordinary least squares, t-test, P-value etc.), while `sklearn` focus on machine learning algorithms and predictions. (Recommend)
  - Please learn how to organize your code by using cells in `.ipynb` file. (IMPORTANT)
  - Give a clear or brief explanation if your code is not one single file. (try to learn from `2023200609`.)
  - Your comments on ***how*** to select models?
