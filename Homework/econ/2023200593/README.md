#### HW1: sololearn certificates

- Done


#### HW2: University Applications Letters Generator

- Score: Please check in the Class `Econ` `.md` file.
- Comments:
   - You can improve your code with `random` universities (we want to randomly select universities from different rank groups.)
   - U don't need a function('get_research_areas') when u only need to import data
   - U can try to figure out why some PDFs failed during the first conversion (error messages), which is not compulsory
 
 
#### HW3: My_Data_My_Model

- Score: Please check in the Class `Econ` `.md` file.
- Comments:
   - You are expected to use `statsmodels` library for your linear regression model for data statistics (ordinary least squares, t-test, P-value etc.), while `sklearn` focus on machine learning algorithms and predictions. (Recommend)
   - You can also add fixed effects to your OLS model by using `linearmodels.panel.PanelOLS`.
   - Great job in data visualization.
