#### HW1: sololearn certificates

- Done


#### HW2: University Applications Letters Generator

- Score: 9.0
- Comments:
    - Great application of `Class`.
    - You can improve your code with `random` universities (we want to randomly select universities from different rank groups.) It will be much better.

#### HW3: My_Data_My_Model

- Score: 8.5
- Comments:
  - You can flexibly use `multi-level headings (#, ##) + numbering (1.1.1, 1.1.2)` to make the notebook more visually appealing and easier to navigate.
  - `statmodel` is more recomended dealing linear regression, as sklearn is a package for machine learning
