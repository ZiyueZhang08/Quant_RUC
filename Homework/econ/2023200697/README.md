#### HW1: sololearn certificates

- Done


#### HW2: University Applications Letters Generator
- Score: 9.0
- Comments:
    - .py is okay, but u can try using .ipynb next time.
    - You can improve your code with `random` universities (we want to randomly select universities from different rank groups.)
    - Please DO NOT upload your data files to git.


#### HW3: My_Data_My_Model

- Score: 8.5
- Comments:
    - You can `import` only in the beginning of your code. No need to import in every cell.
    - Please save all the `log` and `output` information with you in the `.ipynb` file.
    - You are expected to use `statsmodels` library for your linear regression model for data statistics (ordinary least squares, t-test, P-value etc.), while `sklearn` focus on machine learning algorithms and predictions. (Recommend)
