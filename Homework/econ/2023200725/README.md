#### HW1: sololearn certificates

- Done


#### HW2: University Applications Letters Generator
- Score: 8.5
- Comments:
    - Package imports can be centralized in a single code block.
    - Too much raw data in the code affects readability.
    - Use `os.path.join` to construct the full path.


#### HW3: My_Data_My_Model

- Score: 8.5
- Comments:
    - You can `import` only in the beginning of your code. No need to import in every cell.
    - You can try to run the code without the parameter `MAX_PAGES`.
    - In your `data analysis.ipynb` file, the `sell_df` is not defined.
    - You are expected to use `statsmodels` library for your linear regression model for data statistics (ordinary least squares, t-test, P-value etc.), while `sklearn` focus on machine learning algorithms and predictions. (Recommend)
    - Your comments on how to select different models? (only using $R^2$ or other metrics?)
