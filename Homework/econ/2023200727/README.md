- Done


#### HW2: University Applications Letters Generator

- Score: Please check in the Class `Econ` `.md` file.
- Comments:
    - Data scraping is not the focus of this assignment, you can input the data manually.
    - You can improve your code with `random` universities (we want to randomly select universities from different rank groups.)
    - One Suggestion: you can use `str.split()` to separate universities and departments——no need for regular expressions. Nice try, though!
