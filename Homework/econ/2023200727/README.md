#### HW1: sololearn certificates

- Done


#### HW2: University Applications Letters Generator

- Score: Please check in the Class `Econ` `.md` file.
- Comments:
    - Data scraping is not the focus of this assignment, you can input the data manually.
    - You can improve your code with `random` universities (we want to randomly select universities from different rank groups.)
    - One Suggestion: you can use `str.split()` to separate universities and departments——no need for regular expressions. Nice try, though!


#### HW3: My_Data_My_Model

- Score: Please check in the Class `Econ` `.md` file.
- Comments:
    - Please save all the `log` and `output` information with you in the `.ipynb` file. (IMPORTANT, next time will influence your score.)
    - You are expected to use `statsmodels` library for your linear regression model for data statistics (ordinary least squares, t-test, P-value etc.), while `sklearn` focus on machine learning algorithms and predictions. (Recommend) And not recommend to use `numpy` for matrix operations.
    - You only use `MAE` to selct your model, but you can also use `MSE` or `RMSE` or `$R^2$` to compare the performance of different models more comprehensively. (Recommend)
