#### HW1: sololearn certificates

- Done


#### HW2: University Applications Letters Generator

- Score: 8.5
- Suggestion: 
    - `import` can be wrote in just one cell.
    - Some `functions` are not necessary, but it's great to try and practise.
    - You can reorganize your code to some extend, such as the test cell (you can `comment` that.)

#### HW3: My_Data_My_Model

- Score: 9.0
- Comments:
  - You can flexibly use `multi-level headings (#, ##) + numbering (1.1.1, 1.1.2)` to make the notebook more visually appealing and easier to navigate.
