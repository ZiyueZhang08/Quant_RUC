#### HW1: sololearn certificates

- Done


#### HW2: University Applications Letters Generator

- Score: 8.5
- Comments:
    - Sorry to mention but clearly the code is generated by *Generative AI*.
    - You can improve your code with `random` universities (we want to randomly select universities from different rank groups.)
    - We expect you to consider and explain why there are some **errors & fails** in the process that convert `docx` to `pdf` files.
 
#### HW3: My_Data_My_Model

- Score: 9.0
- Comments:
  - The `execution history` of the code needs to be preserved, which is why you are required to submit an `.ipynb` file instead of a `.py` file.
  - All your code is concentrated in a single block, which doesn't leverage the advantages of .ipynb. Next time, try splitting the code into logical segments and running them separately to improve readability and convenience.
