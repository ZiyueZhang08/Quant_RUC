#### HW1: sololearn certificates

- Done


#### HW2: University Applications Letters Generator

- Score: 8.5
- Suggestions:
    - You can improve your code with `random` universities (we want to randomly select universities from different rank groups.)

#### HW3: My_Data_My_Model

- Score: 8.5
- Comments:
  - Only `import` at the beginning of the code; no need to import in every cell.
  - Your code blocks are too long, you can better reorganize them by seperating function defining and code running
  - You can flexibly use `multi-level headings (#, ##) + numbering (1.1.1, 1.1.2)` to make the notebook more visually appealing and easier to navigate.
