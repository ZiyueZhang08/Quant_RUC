#### HW1: sololearn certificates

- Done


#### HW2: University Applications Letters Generator

- Score: 8.5
- Suggestions: 
    - You can improve your code with `random` universities (we want to randomly select universities from different rank groups.)

#### HW3: My_Data_My_Model

- Score: 8.5
- Comments:
  - beautifulsoup is ok, but you can try `selenium driver.find_elements` to search the info needed
  - Some log of regression model is missing, which is needed, try preserving the outcome in your code next time.
